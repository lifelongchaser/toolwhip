#summary The pending tasks to be done for distcc

The pending tasks for the distcc work
  * finish out --hostinfo - mark
  * -include
  * -isysroot
     * include_server needs to know that -x and -isysroot can alter the set of default system search directories.  CompilerDefaults' self.system_dirs_default already seems to accept language as a dimension for variance, this can probably be tied to -x if it's not already.  -isysroot should be added as an additional dimension.
  * split out include dirs from framework dirs
  * see if we need to beef up -F support in the include server
  * reintegrate xcodedistcc advertisement via dns_sd (apple)/avahi (linux)
  * what happens if you pass already-preprocessed input like .i and .ii to the include server?
  * double check DashONoSpace_Case since gcc -ofoo -c foo.c seems to work?
  * move the language bits into helper objects so we don't have to repeat so much in the tests

done:
  * -x support
     * -x in distcc/distccd -- code and tests added
     * -x in include_server -- parse_command already picks it all up, and compiler_defaults moves it along collecting the system dirs correctly.
  * probably don't need to do anything with these except stop collecting -arch:
     * -arch support in the include_server doesn't seem to do anything w/ what it collects
     * -arch support probably needs to support building >1 arch at a time like gcc does.
