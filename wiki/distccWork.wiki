#summary The pending tasks to be done for distcc

The pending tasks for the distcc work
  * finish out --hostinfo - mark
  * -isysroot
     * include_server needs to know that -x and -isysroot can alter the set of default system search directories.  CompilerDefaults' self.system_dirs_default already seems to accept language as a dimension for variance, this can probably be tied to -x if it's not already.  -isysroot should be added as an additional dimension.
  * split out include dirs from framework dirs
  * see if we need to beef up -F support in the include server
  * reintegrate xcodedistcc advertisement via dns_sd (apple)/avahi (linux)
  * what happens if you pass already-preprocessed input like .i and .ii to the include server?
  * move the language bits into helper objects so we don't have to repeat so much in the tests
  * -iframework like -isystem

done:
  * -x support
     * -x in distcc/distccd -- code and tests added
     * -x in include_server -- parse_command already picks it all up, and compiler_defaults moves it along collecting the system dirs correctly.
  * probably don't need to do anything with these except stop collecting -arch:
     * -arch support in the include_server doesn't seem to do anything w/ what it collects
     * -arch support probably needs to support building >1 arch at a time like gcc does.
  * -include - already worked, added test case
  * double check DashONoSpace_Case since gcc -ofoo -c foo.c seems to work?



Things to point out to apple
  * the gcc version must also bump if the sdks change in any way due to how system headers are moved over the wire, they need to match between all machines so they see the same headers.
