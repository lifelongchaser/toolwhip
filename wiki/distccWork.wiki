#summary The pending tasks to be done for distcc

The pending tasks for the distcc work
  * -x support -- tvl
     * -x in distcc/distccd
     * -x in include_server
  * finish out --hostinfo - mark
  * -include
  * -isysroot
     * include_server needs to know that -x and -isysroot can alter the set of default system search directories.  CompilerDefaults' self.system_dirs_default already seems to accept language as a dimension for variance, this can probably be tied to -x if it's not already.  -isysroot should be added as an additional dimension.
  * split out include dirs from framework dirs
  * see if we need to beef up -F support in the include server
  * reintegrate xcodedistcc advertisement via dns_sd (apple)/avahi (linux)
